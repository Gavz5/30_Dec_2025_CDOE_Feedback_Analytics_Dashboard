The BCom structure is completely stupid. You force us to study useless subjects and the important subjects for our career are optional. This shows how careless and unplanned your entire academic system is.

Your teachers cannot teach properly. Most of the online classes are a waste of time because the faculty cannot explain anything in a clear way. We don’t understand half the lectures and still you expect us to perform in exams. You didn’t even complete the syllabus and you started examinations. This is irresponsible and unacceptable.

You take full tuition fees but you fail to provide basic teaching. Distance education needs more support, not this nonsense. Many students are worried about failing because your teaching quality is terrible.

During exams there is so much noise from your own staff outside the classroom. It clearly shows you don’t respect students or their exams. It completely destroys concentration and ruins our paper.

On top of that, you actually came inside the exam hall in the middle of the exam just to announce that we should give your college a review. This is completely unprofessional and shows that you care more about collecting feedback than allowing students to write their paper peacefully.

Your examination system is extremely slow. Taking an entire month for just seven exams is ridiculous. Everything here feels lazy, unprofessional and badly handled.

I am completely disappointed and angry with this college. Nothing here is organized and nothing here feels like proper education. This has been the worst college experience I have ever had.
